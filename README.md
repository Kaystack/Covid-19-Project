# My Portfolio

# Introduction
This project explores COVID-19 data in Nigeria, utilizing a variety of SQL skills such as joins, CTEs, temp tables, window and aggregate functions, and view creation. Through a series of queries and analyses, the project presents insights into the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in Nigeria, what percentage of the population has been infected, and the countries with the highest infection and death rates. It also breaks down data by continent and presents global statistics. Finally, the project visualizes the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. By demonstrating a range of SQL techniques and providing valuable insights into a current global crisis, this project showcases my data analysis skills and ability to extract meaningful information from complex datasets.
